## About Myself:

I have an experience with Microsoft technology like WinForms, WPF on C#, also I’ve managed to work for a month for a company where I’ve worked with pure PHP and MySQL.

I’ve participated in intercity competition NeuroTechCup, where i have developed a game with analog streams that are received from Electroencephalography using PyGame library. As a result we’ve got sort off “Boss training”

My English is pretty weak, but it’s enough to read technical documentation without any trouble.

I have a strong motivation to get into team of professional programmes and adopt an experience from them for future career growth

## Code example

["Does my number look big in this?" KATA from CODEWARS](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5287e858c6b5a9678200083c)

A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of
digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

    1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938

The Challenge:

Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic
number in base 10. This may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.

Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be
passed into the function.

```JavaScript 
function narcissistic(value) {
    var numbers = String(value).split('');
    var sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        parseInt(sum += numbers[i] ** numbers.length);
    }
    if (sum === value) return true;
    else return false;
}
```
